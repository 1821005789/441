    <h2>Common functions and features of JavaScript</h2>

 <p class="p3">   
    1. Check the user's browser and operating system.
    JavaScript is very capable in detecting users' browser and operating system information. 
    Although JavaScript runs on every platform, it may happen that we need the user's browser to process it. 
    This is helpful for writing codes that produce different outputs in different browsers.<br>
   
    2. Simple client computing
    As JavaScript is a client-side technology, it can perform basic calculations on the browser. 
    The browser does not need to ask the server time for each task. 
    This is especially useful when users need to perform these calculations repeatedly. 
    In these cases, connecting to the server will take more time than performing the actual calculation.<br>
   
    3. Better control
    JavaScript provides greater control for the browser, instead of completely relying on the Web server. 
    JavaScript provides additional functions for various browsers, which helps to reduce server load and network traffic.<br>
